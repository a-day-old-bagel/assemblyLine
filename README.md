Assembly Line is a small templated header-only C++ library. It is meant to be used in systems that deal with lots of data being streamed through many different operations, or "modules". A module is any logic that accepts incoming data, uses or changes it in some way and then streams it right back out as fast as it can. A chain of these modules constitues an assembly line. These modules can be run on separate threads without complication. This code was original written to help with processing lidar data in real time.
